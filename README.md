The innovation that is close to the Mercedes Autopilot is Tesla Autopilot. Tesla announced their pilot in 2014, which was a little less advanced. Tesla needed the driver to be focused and sometimes engage, while Mercedes can fully drive automatically, and driver does not need to be engaged. However, I think that Tesla Autopilot was a better innovation from the perspective of being new in market and creating a bigger resonance. 

In my opinion it is better to concentrate in Germany as the Mercedes is a German car and every innovation that they make will be first adopted there. Also, it based on Deloitteâ€™s studies 69% of Germans want to have the innovative cars with advanced autonomy technologies and 70% of them want to have advanced safety technologies. Thus, I think that it is better to analyze using specific region which is Germany. Also, in a lot of countries the roads are not as good to use for autopilot cars. 

As I did not manage to find the real dataset of the tesla sales of their autopilot I took it estimated from the link that I have provided.
